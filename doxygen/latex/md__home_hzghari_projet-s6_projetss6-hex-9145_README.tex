Welcome to our Hex project !

Three stategies were implemented during this project, a random strategy, a blocking strategy, a minimax strategy and a Kirchhoff strategy.

vrandom.\+so is our random player bloker.\+so is our blocking player aresistance.\+so is our resistance (Kirchhoff) player. minimax.\+so is our minimax player

To compile our code use the command \char`\"{}make\char`\"{}

To compile tests use \char`\"{}make test\char`\"{}

To run tests afterwards use \char`\"{}./install/alltests\char`\"{}

To generate a game use the command \+: \char`\"{}.\+install/server -\/m \mbox{[}\+M\mbox{]} -\/t \mbox{[}\+T\mbox{]} ./install/player1.\+so ./install/player2.\+so\char`\"{} -\/m allows the manipulation of the size of the board -\/t allows the manipulation of the form of the board. Use \char`\"{}h\char`\"{} for hexagonal, \char`\"{}c\char`\"{} for square, \char`\"{}t\char`\"{} for triangle
